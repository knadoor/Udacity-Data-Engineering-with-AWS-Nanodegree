# Data Engineering with AWS Nanodegree
This repository is for the projects I've done on the [Data Engineering with AWS Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027).

## Project overview
### 1 - Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
Development of an ETL pipeline to pull event data files from a remote source (such as S3), merging the data files as a single CSV and loading 
to a Apache Cassandra NoSQL database.<br>
<b>Project overview:</b><br>
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis 
team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the 
results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring 
you on the project. Your role is to create a database for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database by running queries given to you by the 
analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.<br>
<b>Skills used:</b><br>
Cassandra Query Language (CQL), Python/Pandas, Jupyter
